# Machine Learning for Kids

## What is this?

This is the set of project worksheets and documentation for [Machine Learning for Kids](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk).

It's a tool aimed at children, which introduces machine learning by providing them with hands-on experiences for training simple machine learning systems and building things with them.

The worksheets provide step-by-step instructions to guide students through training a machine learning model and using it build a project in Scratch that represents a real-world use of artificial intelligence.

They can be found at https://MachineLearningForKids.co.uk/worksheets
